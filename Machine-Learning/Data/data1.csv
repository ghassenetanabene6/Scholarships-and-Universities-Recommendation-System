Similarly few global organizations better understand the transformative impactful nature of breaking down boundaries transcending cultures and connecting the previously unconnected.A study conducted by San Diego State University (SDSU) conveys that clear results are emerging on the impact of study abroad and international internships on the career development of international business students during the past decade and a half. The study asserts that “solid evidence now supports the contention that students with an experiential international education compete more successfully than their peers in today’s global workforce.” The study goes on to state that “international educators are now finding themselves equipped with solid empirical data to verify what they have always assumed to be true: learning in an international/intercultural setting not only transforms students’ lives it clearly enhances their career development.”A related study conducted by Rice University goes on to outline many of the characteristics students acquire during the course of an international program that makes them far more marketable to employers from a global business perspective following graduation. The study finds that students who study internationally are much more likely to be able to:Creatively solve problems by applying familiar concepts to unfamiliar situationsContribute to an ethnically diverse teamBe self-confident yet able to listen and learn from people whose value systems are differentTake personal risks and act independentlyBe flexible and adaptable to rapidly changing situationsHave a basic command of the local language and be able use it in practical situationsImagine forecast analyze or address business situations from a different cultural frame of reference.As a global organization MyUS.com has a growing vested interest in preparing tomorrow’s future international business leaders for long-term success. As such we invite all students who meet the criteria listed below to apply for this inaugural scholarship.To qualify for scholarship consideration eligible students must currently be studying abroad have been accepted to a study abroad program or have studied abroad within the past two academic years. Students are required to write a 500-word essay detailing why they chose an international program how they feel that program will enhance their studies (or did enhance their studies) and how they feel that program will likely impact their perspectives relative to other cultures and the impact that will have on future business successes.Additionally the essay should clearly articulate how they believe their experience studying abroad will make them increasingly competitive in today’s global job market.,https://www.myus.com/scholarships/the-global-perspectives-scholarship/

Optimizemyfirm.com Law Firm Marketing Scholarship,Bachelor Course,$1000,15 May 2020,In order to be eligible to apply for the scholarship applicants must be planning on attending an accredited United States college or university in 2020. This is open to high school seniors who have a 3.0 GPA or higher. To apply please include a short essay and your info as requested below.**The Essay**Please write a 500ish word article telling us how you would market a personal injury law firm. Alternatively YouTube videos or other creations will be accepted as well (there’s really no right or wrong way to do this).Imagine you are a good ethical attorney who helps people when insurers are working against them and you are seeking new leads from injured clients. How would you get them? You could be a solo operation who takes in 5 or 6 good cases each year or you could have a large firm with a team of attorneys and a large advertising budget.Many traditional forms of marketing simply do not work – especially since nobody really wants an attorney. Historically many personal injury law firms relied upon word of mouth advertising or phone book advertising. These days some law firms use branding and repetitive television commercials. Others rely on showing up in Google search results so that when people need a lawyer and have the intention of finding one they’re easily accessible. And yet others find a very specific niche such as motorcycles.,Winner will get 1000$ Scholarship Prize Money,How to Apply:Please include your essay or a link to your creation along with the following information and email it to the mentioned email address on our site.Name (First & last)Email addressPhone numberAddressBirth dateCurrent High SchoolCollege you plan on attendingDegree you are seekingCurrent GPA (cumulative)How did you hear about this scholarship?,Welcome to the OptimizeMyFirm Law Firm Marketing Scholarship.

One trip per year to the US to visit Northrop Grumman is anticipated and travel funds to attend international conferences will also be provided. This scholarship is open to both domestic and international candidates. A Tuition Fee Scholarship (TFS) will be provided by UNSW to successful international candidates. The deadline for applications is 15th January 2018. The student is expected to commence studies at UNSW Sydney by March 31 2018.,Contact r.malaney@unsw.edu.au,Quantum communication via low-orbit satellites offers up a paradigm shift in telecommunications. Providing for unparalleled communication security this emerging technology will also lead us into the development of the global quantum internet. This research area was given a large boost recently with the launch of the World's first quantum satellite by China. This new satellite creates entangled photon pairs beaming them down to Earth for subsequent processing and use in a range of communication scenarios. In this PhD project we will leverage optical quantum communications quantum error correction and channel modelling to deliver novel and optimized quantum communication protocols specifically designed for the turbulent atmospheric paths traversed by entangled photons emanating from a satellite. We will be particularly focussed on quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols and the resulting ultra-secret key rates that can be produced from the different variants of such protocols. We will consider multiple quantum information carriers such as those involving discrete variables (DV) coded into single photons and continuous variables (CV) coded into weak laser pulses. Manipulation of these quantum states will involve feedback mechanisms based partially on assessments of the satellite-to-ground channels. This work will lead to state-of-the-art quantum communication protocols that optimize secure communication throughput over very large distances. It offers the PhD candidate the opportunity to enter an exciting and emerging technology frontier that is positioned at the interface of advanced quantum physics and satellite-based communications.,https://www.engineering.unsw.edu.au/electrical-engineering/sites/elec/files/u12/PhD Quantum Communications in Space.pdf

The next 15 years of creating a sustainable real estate industry come from the implementation of new technology and systems.Therefore we are proud to take action ourselves by announcing our Climate Scholarship that will help promising scholars to take the next step in their work towards creating a sustainable real estate industry.Onwards Alexander Åquist co-founder,https://yta.se/blogg/scholarship/

We do not support degree programs at universities. Candidates are encouraged to browse the ICWA archives on this website to see the kind of projects that the Institute had previously supported.The fellowships amount to a generous investment in the future of the Fellow. A primary selection criterion is whether a candidate is ready for the rapid personal growth that the fellowship makes possible. We look for candidates who are sufficiently prepared to take advantage of the opportunity we offer but extensive professional experience in the proposed area is not always an advantage. Fellowships are aimed at developing knowledge and professional skills not awarding research or reporting opportunities to those who already have them.We are primarily focused on the potential of the candidate and secondarily on the project. That said strong candidates will naturally propose and passionately pursue a project that’s topical and important. We’re a small organization with few hard-and-fast rules but generally we will postpone consideration of a project in a country where we currently or very recently have had a fellow. Over time we try to achieve a good geographic distribution of fellowships and are naturally drawn to areas of the world and topics that are less well understood and have strategic or other importance to the United States. These could include thematic fellowships for example examining questions related to economic development or the environment that could be effectively pursued using the method of our fellowships.,https://icwa.wpengine.com/apply/
