Similarly few global organizations better understand the transformative impactful nature of breaking down boundaries transcending cultures and connecting the previously unconnected.A study conducted by San Diego State University (SDSU) conveys that clear results are emerging on the impact of study abroad and international internships on the career development of international business students during the past decade and a half. The study asserts that “solid evidence now supports the contention that students with an experiential international education compete more successfully than their peers in today’s global workforce.” The study goes on to state that “international educators are now finding themselves equipped with solid empirical data to verify what they have always assumed to be true: learning in an international/intercultural setting not only transforms students’ lives it clearly enhances their career development.”A related study conducted by Rice University goes on to outline many of the characteristics students acquire during the course of an international program that makes them far more marketable to employers from a global business perspective following graduation. The study finds that students who study internationally are much more likely to be able to:Creatively solve problems by applying familiar concepts to unfamiliar situationsContribute to an ethnically diverse teamBe self-confident yet able to listen and learn from people whose value systems are differentTake personal risks and act independentlyBe flexible and adaptable to rapidly changing situationsHave a basic command of the local language and be able use it in practical situationsImagine forecast analyze or address business situations from a different cultural frame of reference.As a global organization MyUS.com has a growing vested interest in preparing tomorrow’s future international business leaders for long-term success. As such we invite all students who meet the criteria listed below to apply for this inaugural scholarship.To qualify for scholarship consideration eligible students must currently be studying abroad have been accepted to a study abroad program or have studied abroad within the past two academic years. Students are required to write a 500-word essay detailing why they chose an international program how they feel that program will enhance their studies (or did enhance their studies) and how they feel that program will likely impact their perspectives relative to other cultures and the impact that will have on future business successes.Additionally the essay should clearly articulate how they believe their experience studying abroad will make them increasingly competitive in today’s global job market.,https://www.myus.com/scholarships/the-global-perspectives-scholarship/,,Un,

Creativity is the air each one of us breathes but sometimes we get so concerned with grades that we forget that imagination is our natural problem solver.One way to showcase your creativity is to innovate either by solving a problem by designing something that helps others solve problems or by enhancing our relationship with whatever matters to us.Innovation brings together in unique ways our technical skills and our hopes for a better world.It also provides opportunities for gaining real-working experience in a chosen field and gives students the chance to connect with adults outside their circle who might be able to help students get into their top choice college or get an internship. In the end innovation makes people look at the bigger picture which is the best preparation for college and for life.We at Get Plus Followers are passionate about sparking the creative genius in students and would love to commend those outstanding students who have a made a difference in the lives of others in some innovative or technological fashion. In order to achieve this we have established a scholarship for students who meet certain criteria.,https://getplusfollowers.com/scholarship/,,,4

Quantum Communications from Space,,37000.0,2018-01-15,China,0.0,1.0,0.0,Quantum communication via low-orbit satellites offers up a paradigm shift in telecommunications. Providing for unparalleled communication security this emerging technology will also lead us into the development of the global quantum internet. This research area was given a large boost recently with the launch of the World's first quantum satellite by China. This new satellite creates entangled photon pairs beaming them down to Earth for subsequent processing and use in a range of communication scenarios. In this PhD project we will leverage optical quantum communications quantum error correction and channel modelling to deliver novel and optimized quantum communication protocols specifically designed for the turbulent atmospheric paths traversed by entangled photons emanating from a satellite. We will be particularly focussed on quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols and the resulting ultra-secret key rates that can be produced from the different variants of such protocols. We will consider multiple quantum information carriers such as those involving discrete variables (DV) coded into single photons and continuous variables (CV) coded into weak laser pulses. Manipulation of these quantum states will involve feedback mechanisms based partially on assessments of the satellite-to-ground channels. This work will lead to state-of-the-art quantum communication protocols that optimize secure communication throughput over very large distances. It offers the PhD candidate the opportunity to enter an exciting and emerging technology frontier that is positioned at the interface of advanced quantum physics and satellite-based communications.,https://www.engineering.unsw.edu.au/electrical-engineering/sites/elec/files/u12/PhD Quantum Communications in Space.pdf,,,0

Institute for Current World Affairs - FELLOWSHIPS,,,,USA,0.0,1.0,0.0,The ICWA fellowship program aims to nurture deep expertise in foreign countries and cultures by supporting a Fellow who carries out a program of self-designed independent study abroad for a minimum of two years. We do not support degree programs at universities. Candidates are encouraged to browse the ICWA archives on this website to see the kind of projects that the Institute had previously supported.The fellowships amount to a generous investment in the future of the Fellow. A primary selection criterion is whether a candidate is ready for the rapid personal growth that the fellowship makes possible. We look for candidates who are sufficiently prepared to take advantage of the opportunity we offer but extensive professional experience in the proposed area is not always an advantage. Fellowships are aimed at developing knowledge and professional skills not awarding research or reporting opportunities to those who already have them.We are primarily focused on the potential of the candidate and secondarily on the project. That said strong candidates will naturally propose and passionately pursue a project that’s topical and important. We’re a small organization with few hard-and-fast rules but generally we will postpone consideration of a project in a country where we currently or very recently have had a fellow. Over time we try to achieve a good geographic distribution of fellowships and are naturally drawn to areas of the world and topics that are less well understood and have strategic or other importance to the United States. These could include thematic fellowships for example examining questions related to economic development or the environment that could be effectively pursued using the method of our fellowships.,https://icwa.wpengine.com/apply/,,,

Regarding the research employability track the student has to interact with two tutors of two different countries to prepare the master thesis permitting the familiarization with requirements of international research requirements.The WOP-P Master takes into account different aspects. First it differentiates between and encompasses the three fields of the discipline: work organizational and personnel psychology.

Third it follows well-recognized efforts at the European level such as the EUROPSY education and professional competencies model for the European Certificate of Psychology supported by the European Federation of Psychology Associations (EFPA) and the Specialist EuroPsy Certificate in WOP Psychology.Fourth the Master adheres to the scientist-practitioner model integrating science and practice in a mutual interaction. The Master not only includes evidence-based contents but these contents are also combined with methodology and research activities.
